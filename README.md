# otto2.0

written in node reeeeee

A rewrite of @retep's Otto iMessages bot in NodeJS

We're just doing basic framework and testing right now.

# Only runs on MacOS!
We're using MacOS 10.13 High Sierra

# Install
`npm install` should be fine


- We use [osa-imessage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osa-imessage) to
do the things, it seems pretty great :ok_hand:

# TO DO
[ ] Get basic framework ready
  [x] Test out sending/receiving module
  [ ] Convert handles to real names *somehow* (Probably will end up
  being an external list from somewhere
  [ ] Test out importing external files
  [ ] Allow use of library.js for all functions that Otto can do
  [ ] Support for multiple DMs and/or group chats
[ ] Write all functions
[ ] Finish up, allow easy adding of custom functions
