# otto2.0

written in node reeeeee

A rewrite of @retep's Otto iMessages bot in NodeJS

We're just doing basic framework and testing right now.

# Only runs on MacOS!
We're using MacOS 10.13 High Sierra

# Install
`npm install` should be fine


- We use [osa-imessage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osa-imessage) to
do the things, it seems pretty great :ok_hand:

# TO DO
- [ ] Get basic framework ready
  - [x] Test out sending/receiving module
  - [x] Convert handles to real names *somehow* (Probably will end up
  being an external list from somewhere, but want a fancy applescript
  thing)
  - [x] Test out importing external files
  - [ ] Allow use of library.js for all functions that Otto can do
  - [ ] Configurations/settings also in library.js (Location of
    contacts library, etc.)
  - [ ] Support for multiple DMs and/or group chats
- [ ] Write all functions
- [ ] Finish up, allow easy adding of custom functions
